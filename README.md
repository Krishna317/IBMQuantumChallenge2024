# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024 Repository

Welcome to the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024 repository! Here, you will find my solutions to the challenge.

## Overview
The IBM Quantum Challenge 2024 was an extraordinary event, representing the largest IBM quantum challenge to date, with approximately 5000 participants. This year, IBM introduced Qiskit 1.0, the first stable release of the Qiskit SDK, which enables utility-scale quantum computation. The challenge revolved around leveraging Qiskit 1.0 for a variety of quantum computational tasks, catering to both beginners and experienced quantum enthusiasts.

## Key Highlights
- Participant and Mentor: Actively participated and provided mentorship for the first time.
- Completed All Challenges: Successfully completed all the main challenges as well as the bonus challenge.
- Qiskit 1.0: Implemented new features of Qiskit 1.0, focusing on utility-scale experiments with over 100 qubits and integrated AI capabilities with IBM watsonxâ„¢.

About the Challenge
This year's challenge was structured into a series of Jupyter notebooks, referred to as "labs," which guided participants through the fundamentals and advanced topics of Qiskit. The labs included:

### Tutorial Material:
Educational content aimed at newcomers to learn about quantum computing and Qiskit.

### Code Examples:
Practical examples to facilitate understanding of quantum concepts.

### Auto-Graded Coding Challenges:
Interactive coding problems to apply the concepts learned.

The challenge not only covered the basics of quantum computing but also showcased the capabilities of Qiskit 1.0, including:

- New Integrations: Enhanced features for quantum experiments and AI integration.
- Utility-Scale Quantum Computing: Demonstrated the process of working with utility-scale quantum experiments, targeting those with 100 or more qubits.
